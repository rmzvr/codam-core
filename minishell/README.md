# Project Folder Structure

This project follows a structured directory layout to maintain clarity and organization. Below is a breakdown of each directory and its purpose:

```
├── build                   intermediate build files (e.g., *.o) created by make
├── docs                    project documentation
├── includes                header files
├── libs                    third-party libraries
├── scripts                 scripts for setup and other tasks
├── sources                 C source files
├── tests                   contains test files
├── .gitignore              specifies files and directories to be ignored by git
├── Makefile                build instructions for the project
└── README.md               project overview and documentation
```

### Folder Details
- **build:** Stores intermediate build files, typically object files (`*.o`), generated during the build process.
- **docs:** Contains project documentation, including design documents, guides, or API references.
- **includes:** Holds header files (`*.h`), defining interfaces and shared declarations.
- **libs:** Contains third-party libraries that the project depends on.
- **scripts:** Includes utility scripts for setup, automation, or other project-related tasks.
- **sources:** Source code files, primarily C files (`*.c`). This is where the application's logic resides.
- **tests:** Test files for validating project functionality.

### Additional Files
- **.gitignore:** Defines files and folders that should be ignored by Git to keep the repository clean.
- **Makefile:** Provides build commands and automates compilation steps.
- **README.md:** Offers an overview of the project, including setup instructions, usage, and contribution guidelines.
